# Overview
Index and search images based on descriptions generated by a local multimodal LLM.

This application makes a directory of images searchable with text queries. It does this by using a local multimodal LLM (e.g., llava-phi3) via the ollama API to generate descriptions of images, which it then writes to a semantic database (chromadb).

The text embeddings used by chromadb allow for querying the images with text prompots.

# Prerequisites

* [ollama](https://ollama.com/)
* a local multimodal model [supported by ollama](https://ollama.com/library) (e.g., llava-phi3)
* A running ollama service

# Use

To index data, run `main.py`

```
python main.py --directory /path/to/images
```

To query the index, use `--query`

```
python main.py --query "buoy"
```
